Course project - generates random directed graphs and performs certain kinds of analysis.

1. the number of nodes with indegree 0, 
2. the number of nodes with outdegree 0, 
3. the size of a largest weakly connected component, 
4. the size of a largest strongly connected component,
5. the number of directed cycles of length k.

This is a visual implementation of the project.
